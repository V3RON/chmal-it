Since the deprecation of Flipper, React Native has lacked a unified, extensible debugging platform. In this talk, I introduce Rozenite – a new framework designed to fill that gap. I explain how Rozenite hooks into the existing DevTools architecture to allow for custom plugin development with sandboxed execution and React-based UIs. I also showcase official plugins for Redux, TanStack Query, and Network monitoring, demonstrating how developers can now build their own tools to enhance their debugging workflow.
