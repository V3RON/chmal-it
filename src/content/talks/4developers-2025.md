Have you ever wondered how JavaScript really deals with asynchrony? In this presentation, I'll uncover the secrets of the event loop mechanism behind asynchronous JavaScript. You'll learn what micro-tasks and macro-tasks are, how the browser manages background tasks, and how you can control their execution in your code. I'll also show you how to effectively use interesting APIs like `requestIdleCallback` and discuss the future of asynchrony with the upcoming Scheduler API. All presented in a practical context, without frameworks or libraries – just pure, classic JavaScript!
