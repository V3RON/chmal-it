Welcome to my blog!

I'm getting ready to share my experiences working on the bleeding edge of the React Native ecosystem. Expect technical deep dives into:

- **Performance Optimization:** How to make your apps fly on mobile.
- **Developer Tooling:** The internals of Metro, DevTools, and building better DX.
- **Open Source Architecture:** Lessons learned from maintaining libraries used by thousands.

Stay tuned!
