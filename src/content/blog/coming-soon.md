Welcome to my blog!

I'm getting ready to share my experiences working on the bleeding edge of the React Native ecosystem.

## Why Developer Experience Matters

Developer Experience (DX) is more than just pretty themes. It's about reducing friction in the development cycle. When our tools are fast and intuitive, we can stay in the "flow" state longer.

### Faster Feedback Loops

The time between changing a line of code and seeing the result on a device is critical.

## Technical Deep Dives

Expect technical deep dives into:

- **Performance Optimization:** How to make your apps fly on mobile.
- **Developer Tooling:** The internals of Metro, DevTools, and building better DX.
- **Open Source Architecture:** Lessons learned from maintaining libraries used by thousands.

## Conclusion

Stay tuned for more!
